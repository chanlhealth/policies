## About HIPAA compliance

HIPAA compliance really has two halves. The first half includes all technical guidelines, both physical and digital. Compliant companies take measures to secure their hardware and manage their software in a certain way. Encryption, logging, monitoring—these are just a few examples of HIPAA technical requirements. Chanl Health builds its platform with these guidelines in mind.

The second half of HIPAA is focused on administrative and organizational activities. This includes signing Business Associate Agreements (BAAs), and managing company policies like training, among other things. To make sure we align company policies with HIPAA administrative guidelines, we did not build these policies from scratch. 

We began with the [policies open sourced by Datica](https://policy.datica.com), and adapted them to fit our business and needs. Importantly, Datica's policies have been through three external audits—two HIPAA audits and one HITRUST audit. Chanl Health uses Datica's HTRUST CSF Certified digital health platform.
